# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## FoodiesHub

In this project we brought a food website promoting a list of chiefs and dishes prepared by each one of them. However, the main purpose was to show a robust SASS configuration bringing a complex style page. It includes a list of properties such as: theme colors, preferred colors, font size and animation speed. You can choose between the options oferred and set the page layout according to your preference.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
